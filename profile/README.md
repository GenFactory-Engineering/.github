## Projects

The GenFactory engineering team works with a variety of communities in the AI artwork space, including the Unstable Diffusion community from which we originated. We work with high-level content platforms to help them integrate AI artwork to create exciting new user experiences. We also work with artists to help them create AI artwork and to help them sell their artwork on the platforms.

### Goal

> To create a new art form that is accessible to everyone while ensuring the power of AI is not abused, but instead made available to everyone.

### Contributing

Are you a coder, engineer, DevOps, MLOps or Data Scientist? We are looking for people to help us build the future of AI art. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UnstableDiffusion).
