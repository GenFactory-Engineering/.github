### Goal

> To create a new art form that is accessible to everyone while ensuring the power of AI is not abused, but instead made available to everyone.

## Projects

1. API - Marrying together a wide variety of interconnected AI content into a robust API ready for any front-end.
2. Infrastructure - A rapid-scaling and high-availability back-end designed to handle the rapid spin-up times required for inference requests.
3. Moderation - Multiple-mode content interrogation both pre- and post-inference using traditional and ML techniques so content always abides clients' TOS.
4. Community support - Our team believes that everyone, everywhere, should have free and _meaningful_ access to ML and AI technologies, not just the already powerful few.
